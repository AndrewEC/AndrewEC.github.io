				<p>A collection of research and summary reports I have written that mostly focus on
					digital accessibility tools, methods, and standards.</p>

				<h2>Word to PDF Tipsheet</h2>
				<p>Many companies, including the government, choose to
					distribute documents in a PDF format due to the free reader and feature rich capabilities
					of the PDF document.</p>
				<p>This document was released to Ministry employees and provided brief instructions for converting
					a Word document into a PDF while maintining compatibility with assistive technologies.</p>

				<h2>What is WCAG?</h2>
				<p>WCAG, otherwise known as Web Content Accessibility Guidelines, is a set of
						standards and guidelines to help make websites more accessible to
						those who require the use of assistive devices such as screen readers.</p>
				<p>In this document I hope explain some of it's complexities so you can have a
					better understanding of its rules and standards and why we have it.</p>

				<h2>Creating Accessible Emails in Outlook</h2>
				<p>One of the most common methods of transmitting information
					from one person to another is through the use of email.
					In a government setting the email client of choice is, most typically, Microsoft's Outlook.</p>
				<p>This guide targets outlook specifically and tries to provide the users
					with enough information to create their own accessible emails.</p>
